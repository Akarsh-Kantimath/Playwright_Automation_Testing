in the terminal input
npm install playwright

then it asks bunch of questions
after that skeleton of the playwright project is created

.github
nodu_modules - it contains playwright project jars, if we remove it project can't perform any activities
tests - here we write the automation tests
.gitignore
package-lock.json
package.json - while creating the framework this file will be useful
playwright.config.js - it is a file where it's used for configuring the playwright project - an important file
