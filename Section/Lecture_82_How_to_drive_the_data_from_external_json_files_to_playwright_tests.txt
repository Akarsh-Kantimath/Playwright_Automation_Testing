To drive the data from external json file instead of hardcoding it
------------------------------------------------------------------
We can pass the data from any folder, for now we are using utils folder

Inside of it we are creating the placeorderTestData.json file

We are passing the data through Json format

There are 3 datas username, password, productName

placeorderTestData.json file
{
     "username" : "tester_akarsh@gmail.com",
     "password" : "Abcd1234#",
     "productName" : "ADIDAS ORIGINAL"
}

==============================================
to import the json file into .spec.js file
1. first we must convert json -> to String -> to JS object

const dataset = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(require('../___/.json')))

now, that JSON file variables are conveted into object.
We can use the object.property format where ever in .spec.js file those variables are present.


username -> change it to dataset.username
