Inside a tests folder
- create a file UIBasicstest.spec.js


first we have to import a one of the annotation test from the jars of node_modules @playwright/test
rom @playwright package
- const {test} = require('@playwright/test'); - store it in variable const


test() annotation takes two arguments
- first is the test name
- second argument is a function()
test ('First Playwright test', function(){

});


Javascript is asynchronous - we use await key word for each step asking javascript to go step by step
When, we add await to each line inside the function(), we must declare that function is async in the test arugument
test('First Playwright test', async function()
{

});


Anonymous function - function without the name is called anonymous function.
we can skip using function word instead of it ()=>
=> fat operator
In newer version of the JS, ()=> it's auto considered as function()

Now, we can write test as 
test('First Playwright test', async ()=>
{

});
//Thus, it's the outer structure of the test.
