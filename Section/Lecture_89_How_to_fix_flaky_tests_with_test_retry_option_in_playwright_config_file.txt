How to retry the tests when they are failed
============================================
Tests might be failed due to flaky testcases or network issues or synchronization issue of waits 

retries is declared in global config variable

const config = ({
  testDir: './tests',
  retries : 1 , // Maximum time one test can run for
  timeout: 30 * 1000,
  expect: {
    timeout: 5 * 1000,
  },
  reporter: 'html',
  projects: [
    {
      name: 'safari_execution',
      use: {
        browserName: 'webkit',
        headless: false,
        screenshot: 'on', //'off', 'on', 'only-on-failure'  //'on' - captures screenshot after each test.
        trace: 'retain-on-failure', //'on', 'off' , 'retain-on-failure'
        ...devices['iPhone 15']
      }
    },
    {
      name: 'chrome_execution',
      use: {
        browserName: 'chromium',
        headless: false,
        screenshot: 'only-on-failure', //'off', 'on',


==================================================================
In the Playwright test report
status of tests can be seen with
All
Passed
Failed
Flaky
Skipped

-> if the test got passed with retry mechanism, passed result will be considered as a part of Flaky. 
-> We can work on flaky testcases to make them pass with first attempt.
