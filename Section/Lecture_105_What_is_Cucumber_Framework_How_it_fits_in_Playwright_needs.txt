google Cucumber JS and Cucumber JS Github

Cucumber comes in many languages, as currently we are dealing with JS language so, Cucumber JS

So, far we have written Playwright tests with Mocha framework.

Cucumber is also a type of framework, If we want to implement with cucumber framework it's JAR files are available.
 

Cucumber framework is top over layer with nice plain English it let's everyone to understand the test.

Get Started
Let's take this example of something to test:

First, write your main code in src/index.js:
----------------------------------------------
class Greeter {
  sayHello() {
    return 'hello'
  }
}

module.exports = {
  Greeter
}

Then, write your feature in features/greeting.feature:
-------------------------------------------------------
Feature: Greeting

  Scenario: Say hello
    When the greeter says hello
    Then I should have heard "hello"

Next, implement your steps in features/support/steps.js:
---------------------------------------------------------
const assert = require('assert')
const { When, Then } = require('@cucumber/cucumber')
const { Greeter } = require('../../src')

When('the greeter says hello', function () {
  this.whatIHeard = new Greeter().sayHello()
});

Then('I should have heard {string}', function (expectedResponse) {
  assert.equal(this.whatIHeard, expectedResponse)
});
