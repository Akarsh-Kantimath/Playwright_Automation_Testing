Installing typescript
----------------------
google typescript install
npmjs.com/package/typescript

npm install -D typescript

We want to save the typescript in package.json file so,
npm install --save-dev typescript
========================================
Key difference between JavaScript and TypeScript
1. Static Typing : TypeScript checks typesduring development, catching errors before you run your code. JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning type errors only surface at runtime.

2. Strong Typing : TypeScript enforces strict rules about howyou use types, preventing you from accidentally mixing incompatible types. JavaScript is more lenient.




=========================================
2 files are created
demo.js
demo1.ts

=========================================
demo.js

let  message = "Hello";
message = 2;
let age = 20;
let numbers = [1, 2, 3];



=========================================
demo1.ts

let message1 : string = "Hello";
message1 = 2; //Line is displayed with error above message1 variable declared with string type and below we are re-assigning with 2 which is of type number not string.

let age : number = 20;
let isActive : boolean = false;

let number : number[] = [1, 2, 4];

let data : any = "this could be anything"; // if you unsure of any data type decalre the variable with : any it will take care of itself by identifing the data type.
data = 42 ;

console.log(message1);
console.log(age);

to run the typescipt execution, as in the run-time their is no environment, so initially while compling we change the file from ts to js by 
tsc demo1.ts -> it creates demo1.js file
then run the command node demo1.js then the file is executed.
