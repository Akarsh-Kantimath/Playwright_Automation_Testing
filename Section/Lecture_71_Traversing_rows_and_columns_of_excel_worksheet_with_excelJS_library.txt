create a file excelDemo.js inside ExcelJSUtils folder 

const ExcelJs = require('exceljs'); //It's importing of excelJS node module



How do we configure the ExcelJS
--------------------------------
It supports .xlsx and json files

Excel .xlsx files are called workbooks

//Creating a object of class
const workbook = new ExcelJs.Workbook();

//File path
workbook.xlsx.readFile(' ___provide the excel file path___');


//Once we open the excel, we have to mention which sheet we are looking
const worksheet = workbook.getWorksheet('Sheet1');
worksheet.eachRow((row, rowNumber)=>{ //It traverse through each row
	row.eachCell((cell, colNumber)=>{ //It traverse through each column
		console.log(cell.value);



	})


})

-------------------------------------------------------------
As JavaScript is asynchronous, we can handle it in two ways.

1. using .then() continued with .readFile() wrapping the row and column to get cell value. Upon mentioning the path, it waits for the promise.


const workbook = new ExcelJs.Workbook();

//If we didn't write then(function(){}) as JS is asynchronous before even looking for file it jumps to worksheet 

workbook.xlsx.readFile(' ___provide the excel file path___').then(function() {

//Once we open the excel, we have to mention which sheet we are looking
const worksheet = workbook.getWorksheet('Sheet1');
worksheet.eachRow((row, rowNumber)=>{
	row.eachCell((cell, colNumber)=>{
		console.log(cell.value);



	})


})

}

---------------------------------------------------------------
2. second way is by using async and await keywords


const workbook = new ExcelJs.Workbook();

async function excelTest(){
await workbook.xlsx.readFile(' ___provide the excel file path___');


//Once we open the excel, we have to mention which sheet we are looking
const worksheet = workbook.getWorksheet('Sheet1');
worksheet.eachRow((row, rowNumber)=>{
	row.eachCell((cell, colNumber)=>{
		console.log(cell.value);



	})


})
}

excelTest(); //on execution of the method, it looks for method and start the execution.
