When response doesn't reach the browser, abort the network call with playwright
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Case: Server is down

in th network .css request is for the forntend design, if you block it your page loads bit faster

test(' ', async({browser})=> {
	const context = await browser.newContext();
	const page = await context.newPage();
	
	// **/* refers to URL anything before / and after /
	// To block .css request while loading a page

	page.route('**/*.css', route => route.abort());

	//block the images while loading the page
	page.route('**/*.{jpg,png,jpeg}, route => rote.abort());


})

//Playwright records each and every request and their response call, You can print it in the output.

//to print all the requests
page.on('request', request => console.log(request.url()));

any request call made a response, below page.on will print the response
page.on('response', response => console.log(response.url(), response.status());
await page.goto('___');
