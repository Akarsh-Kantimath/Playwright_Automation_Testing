To get the title of page and put the assertion
-----------------------------------------------
console.log(await page.title());

Assertion of title - Page has a title
--------------------------------------
from playwright we should explicitely call for expect fixture of playwright.
There are four fixtures of playwright.
1. browser
2. test
3. expect
way to import expect 
const {test, expect} = require('@playwright/test');
So far, we learnt three fixtures.

await expect(page).toHaveTitle('Google');

other browserName in configuration
------------------------------------
use: {
	browserName : 'firefox' //Firefox browser

},

browserName : 'webkit' //for Safari browser

=============================================================================
to run the tests in headed mode, we were using terminal command as
npx playwright test --headed
instead of it, we can configure it in use section of playwright.config.js file
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

use : {
	browserName : 'webkit',
	headless : false, //with this everttime we need not use --headed while running test, instead by 
				npx playwright test triggers the test execution in headed mode

},
