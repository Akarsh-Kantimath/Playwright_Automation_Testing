fixture - in general terminology fixtures are Global variables which are available across the project
--------
fixed set of fixtures which are automatically availble for every test annotation, which are globally available.

test('First Playwright test', async ({browser})=>
{
//we must write browser in curly braces to indentify it as a playwright fixture, if it's written without curly braces it will identified as a string value

});

what is context?
----------------
To create a fresh instance to open a browser context is used
const context = browser.newContext(); //browser instance is opened
context.newPage();

without await browser instance is opened, we must add await in every step as JS is asynchronous
test('First Playwright test', async ({browser})=>
{
	const context = await browser.newContext();
	const page = await context.newPage();
	await page.goto("https://rahulshettyacademy.com/loginpagePractise/");


});


page fixture of playwright
---------------------------
test('First Playwright test', async ({page})=>
{
	//We can eliminate const context and const page by using page fixture of playwright, it automatically does the work of those two steps
	await page.goto("https://rahulshettyacademy.com/loginpagePractise/");

});

=============================================================================================================
There are four playwright fixtures. In that we learnt two of them.
(1) browser (2) page
