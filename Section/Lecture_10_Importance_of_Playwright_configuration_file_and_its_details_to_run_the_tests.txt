playwright.config.js file
------------------------------
It's a heart of the entire the project.


const config = ({     //all the value is stored under const config vatiable, below at the end we can export it.
testDir: './tests',
timeout: 40 * 1000, //It's for all the components wait period 40 seconds
expect: {
	timeout: 40 * 1000,
	}, // this timeout is for assertions, by default 30 sec is already provided by the playwright when you want to overide only then we configure it

reporter: 'html',


use: {
	browserName: 'chromium' //To run the test in chrome browser
},

});

module.exports = config


By default playwright runs the tests in headless mode, we must tell it explicitly to run in headed mode.
How to run the tests in playwright?
-----------------------------------
If there are multiple .spec.js file, tests will run parallel
If in one .spec.js file if there are multiple test annotation, they get executed in sequence.

In terminal, use the command
npx playwright test
//npx - Node Package eXecutor - in the node_modules of project it looks for playwright jar
//test refers to execution of tests
//It runs in headless mode

to run the tests in headed mode, we must mention it explicitly
---------------------------------------------------------------
npx playwright test --headed

If there are multiple test annotation in one spec file and if you want to run only one test in that file then
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
test.only(' test name', async ()=>{ //.only is a helper attribute

});
