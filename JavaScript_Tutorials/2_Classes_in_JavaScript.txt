In Javascript classes were introduced from ES6 engine.

class Person{
	age = 25
//there are two ways property can be decalred inside a class
//first one
	location = 'Canada'

//second way through get method()
	get location(){
		return 'canada'  //But, second way is highly suggested using get method
	}

//you can have constructor to a class
//Constructor is a method which executes by default when you create object of the class.
	constructor(firstName, lastName){
		//Here, firstName and lastName are instance variables
		
		//Ex. age in class variable which don't change it's value, while the constructor instance variables can be changed multiple times with different variable.
	
	//Constructors are evoked by object, instance variables are passed through object during run-time. Tim and Dane are passed as a firstName and lastName;
	
	//Now, Tim and Dane names are only accessible within this constructor. In order to have access to complete class. this key word is used.

	this.firstName = firstName;
	this.lastName = lastName;



	}

	fullName(){
		console.log(this.firstName + this.lastName)

	}


}


//If you want to access any property of a class, first we must create a object of a class, later object.property we can fetch the class property value.

//Declaring of object must be done outside of the class.
let person = new Person('Tim','Dane')

console.log(person.age);

console.log(person.location);//without the () you can get the value of location, it's just a property not method. Because we are using get, it's property not method. While fullName() is a method.

console.log(person.fullName()); //TimDane

let person1 = new Person('Jake','Doris');
console.log(person1.fullName()); //JakeDoris

?? Difference object and class to fullName() method is that
-> In object we hardcoded firstName and lastName, if we need to add one more detail once again we must hardcode, while with the class we can create the class structure once with the multiple object creation we can repetatively use the same class structure to get fullName() through objects.
